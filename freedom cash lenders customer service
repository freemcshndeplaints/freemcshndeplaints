Nick Bourke, director of Pew’s consumer finance project, issued the following statement:

“The measure passed in the Senate today is a thoughtful, bipartisan, and fair compromise that builds upon the framework of the House bill. The Senate version provides lenders with more revenue than under the House’s measure while maintaining strong consumer protections that would end practices that harm Ohio families.

“We appreciate the Senate’s hard work in moving this reform forward. We urge the House to pass the Senate bill promptly so that the governor can sign it as quickly as possible. If this legislation becomes law, Ohio will be a national model for well-balanced and fair-minded reform in states that permit payday lending.”
